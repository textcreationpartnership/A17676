            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>CHriſtian reader, it is a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe that manie handes make light vvorke. But I haue had experience in this vvorke, that many hands haue made long vvorke, or rather no vvorke. This booke at the firſt publishing thereof, for more expedition vvas deliuered to foure to be tranſlated. In vvhoſe hands it hath lyen diſperſed, partly done, partly vndone, for the ſpace almoſt of theſe three yeares. VVherby the publishing therof hath ben hindred. At length I vvas requeſted to take in hand the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlating of the vvhole vvorke, vvhich through Gods mercifull aſſiſtance I haue accomplished, going in truth through the vvhole vvorke, except that vvhich I my ſelfe before had done. vvhich I make knovvne (gentle Reader) not as hunting after praiſe, but to let thee vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that I haue not published other mens doinges vnder mine ovvne name, but mine ovvne labours, as touching the
<pb facs="tcp:7647:3"/>
tranſlation. And for thy more eaſe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this vvorke, and for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof, I thought good to note thus much, that vvhere in reading thou shalt find this marke (*) it directeth thee vnto the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shevving vvhere thou maiſt read that more largely, vvhich is there brieflie noted. Againe vvhere thou shalt find, Obiect. it ſignifieth an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, vvhereby the matter in hande is contraried by the aduerſarie, vvhere An. it ſignifieth an anſvver to the ſame obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. VVhich thinges I thought good to note for thy greater eaſe. And thus beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God to bleſſe thee in reading theſe my labours, I conclude.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE inſtitution of Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> written by Iohn Caluin ſeemeth to me to chalenge to it ſelfe by good right (right worſhipfull) that which being vttered by men moſt wiſe and of ſingular experience, is common almoſt in euery mans mouth, that good things muſt be repeated againe and againe. For ſeing that in things neceſſarie and profitable the ſame things are ſpoken againe &amp; againe: or things ten times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do pleaſe, neither is that ſpoken &amp; repeated too oft, which is neuer ſufficientlie learned, vndoubtly all thoſe which are ſtudious of ſound diuinitie, doe acknowledge long ago that the commodities of this writing are diuerſe &amp; manifold, not onlie to learne but alſo to teach: &amp; not only to the ſowing, watering &amp; new digging, but alſo to gather in the fruit of the fild of the Church. And for theſe cauſes, when at ſuch times as the harueſt began to waxe white in France in times paſt, I was called backe from the courſe of phiſicke which I had alredie ended, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing my ſelf to the practiſe thereof, vnto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of diuinity, and to take vpon me the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I made choice of that worke eſpecialy, next to the holy Bible, to be read &amp; remembred by me. And
<pb facs="tcp:7647:4"/>
as thoſe which go into a garden bedect with infinit varietie of floures, are wont to make a noſegay of all thoſe which either their ſight or ſmell ſhall moſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that it may reſemble and repreſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the garden after they become out of it. So I feeling in that pleaſant garden of diuinitie, wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull ſmels of heauenlie thinges, gathering out of euery ſection of the chapters, as from the knottes and borders of paradiſe ſuch things as did beſt like me, haue framed this Abridgement, that it might neuer ſuffer ſo great pleaſure to depart from mine eyes, minde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. And ſeing there be alwayes ſlaues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than readie, whereby he goeth about to corrupt the trueth with falſhood, and ſo conſequentlie to thruſt her out of her place, &amp; in her ſeat to ſet lying whoſe Father he is, I haue ſet downe moſt ſhort anſweres, which are ſet againſt the obiections of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wherby the Chriſtian champion may know that the dartes which the enemies of chriſtians do ſhake &amp; bend againſt the moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fortreſſe of the truth it ſelfe are but blunt and britle: and that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not only out of this treaſure howſe garniſhed with moſt precious gemmes, being more wealthy, to enrich thoſe which are deſirous of heauenly pearls, or out of this ſtorehowſe being better furniſhed to feede the flocke of Chriſt: but alſo as out of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, being better armed to diſcomfite all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the trueth with whome he ſhall meete, and to beate downe the Monſters of hereſies. And ſeing that this my labour ſuch as it is, ſeemed in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome godly paſtours neither to be miſliked, ne yet to be vnprofitable, or vnworthy of the light, but that it might come abroad for common profit, I thought good not to be againſt it: eſpeciallie ſeing fruites not to be repented of, may be hoped from
<pb facs="tcp:7647:4"/>
thence without anie mans hinderance. But if anie man think that this litle garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is caſt in leſſer knots and ſtrayter alleyes then is meet, I let him not but that he may freelie, when he will, walk in the broad field at his pleaſure. And wheras (Right worſhipfull) I haue platted a garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the dignitie of your name for the head of this litle booke, that it might allure the readers to vewe and peruſe the whole worke, theſe reaſons did eſpecially moue me: Firſt becauſe, I would haue this ſimple teſtimonie of my thankfull minde to be extant for that your vnwearied ſtudie in beſtowing benefites, which I haue often tryed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſeing that you will haue your gorgeous howſe to ſtande open to all the godlie as a common Inne, ſeing that you make that authoritie which you haue gotten by vertue, more firme, by brideling the euill, by releeuing the oppreſſed, by exercyſing iuſtice: &amp; ſeing that your moſt louing wife, a moſt excellent woman, whoſe bountifulneſſe manie do trie, of whoſe curteſie manie mo do ſpeake, at whoſe godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all do wonder, is readie as it were at your el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe happelie to attempt ſo great thinges: finallie ſeing that your whole family doth breath out a ſmel of Chriſtianitie: I ſay ſeing theſe thinges are ſo, if I ſeeke to this your Inne as to a refuge for my labours I ſeeme to aſcribe that to my ſelf, which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the thinge it ſelfe.

               <p n="3">3 This is the reaſon why the holie men did make more account of this mortall life, and of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof, vnder the old Teſtament, as being a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of ſpirituall felicitie, then is now meete to do: ſo on the other ſide God ſhewed more often teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his iudgement vpon the reprobate, in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There is another difference in figures, becauſe the olde Teſtament did make a ſhew onely of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the truth being abſent, and of the ſhadowe in ſteed of the bodie: the newe Teſtament geueth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> truth being preſent, and the ſound bodie*.</p>

Firſt he declareth his good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will toward vs, when he taketh from among men, ſuch as ſhould be his embaſſadours in the world, and repreſent his perſon *. Secondly, this is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> beſt exerciſe vnto humilitie,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note> when as he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to obey his worde, howe ſo euer it be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by men, like to vs*. Laſt of all nothing is more fit to nouriſh mutuall loue, then that men ſhould be knit together with this bonde, when one is made Paſtour to teach the reſt, and the ſcholers receaue from one mouth common doctrine. All this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie doeth Paule deuide into fiue thinges when he ſaith *, The ſame hath made ſome Apoſtles,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories in churches, to examine manners,<note place="margin">Conſiſtories. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.</note> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vices: and beare rule in exerciſing the office of the keyes*.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that power of the keyes hath two parts principallie. The one conſiſteth in preaching the Goſpel*, which is properlie not ſo much power as a miniſterie, if we reſpect men. For Chriſt hath giuen this power to his word, whereof men are miniſters. We ſpeake not of this now.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The other power of binding and looſing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Chriſt*, when hee ſaieth,<note place="margin">What it is to binde and the ende.</note> If anie brother heare not the church, let him be to thee as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or publicane. Verilie I ſay vnto you, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yee ſhall binde, &amp;c. But the church bindeth him whom it excommunicateth:<note place="margin">What to looſe</note> not that it may deſtroy him, but that he may repent: It looſeth him whom it receiueth to communion or fellowſhip: becauſe it doeth as it were make him partaker of the vnitie which it hath in Chriſt Ieſu. And leaſt anie man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the iudgement of the church, the Lord doth teſtify, that it is nothing els but the publiſhing of his ſentence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Obiect.</hi> All theſe thinges laſted but for a time, when as the magiſtrates were as yet aliens fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our religion.<note place="margin">Diſcipline is neceſſarie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> This order is alwaies neceſſarie. Becauſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7647:173"/>
the church doth neither take anie thing to herſelfe which is proper to the Magiſtrate:<note place="margin">The difference betwene the magiſtrat and the church.</note> neither can the Magiſtrate doe this which the church doth: yea the Magiſtrate himſelfe muſt ſometimes be chaſtened, which thing befell Theodoſius Caeſar.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And ſurelie if anie man doe throughly weigh the wordes of Chriſt, hee ſhall plainelie ſee that the ſtate &amp; perpetuall order of the church is deſcribed there, and not any temporall order.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Furthermore the true vſe of Eccleſiaſticall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is,<note place="margin">Vſe of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diction.</note> that offences may be preuented: and if anie offence be riſen, it may be done away. Ther be two things to be conſidered in the vſe: firſt, that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſpiritual power may be quite ſeperated from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the ſword. Secondly, that it be not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred as one man will,<note place="margin">Diſcipline ſeperated from the power of the ſword. Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the ſharpeſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the church.</note> but by a lawefull aſſemblie: both things were obſerued in the purer church. For the holy Biſhops did neither vſe fines nor priſons, but their ſharpeſt puniſhment was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication &amp; that in great neceſſitie, according to the word of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Neither was ſuch power in mans hand onely, that hee might doe whatſoeuer he would, but it did belong to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of Elders, which was in the church,<note place="margin">The Senat of the church.</note> that which the Senate is in the citie. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioyned the whole Cleargie with the Biſhop. And it was an vſuall cuſtome that the iuriſdiction of the church ſhould be exerciſed by the Senate of elders: wherof there were two kinds:<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors*. At length the Biſhop did challendge that to himſelf, which was graunted to the church.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Afterward the Biſhops committed this charge

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Surelie they mock God by this. Some poore man oweth a little money? He is cited: If he appeare he is condemned. Being condemned, vnleſſe he pay he is admoniſhed.

Let vs ſpeak firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of common diſcipline, vnder which all men muſt be: then we will come to the cleargie, which haue their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> proper diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The firſt foundation of the church, is, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate admonitions doe take place: that is, if any man
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7647:175"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doe not his duetie willinglie, that he ſuffer himſelfe to be admoniſhed:<note place="margin">The degrees of como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Priuate admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> and that euerie one ſtudie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh his brother when need is. Eſpeciallie let the Paſtors be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t herein, whoſe dutie it is to preach to the people, and to exhort through euery houſe*. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If any man refuſe admonitions, and deſpiſe two or three witneſſes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20.</note> and if hee continue ſtubborne, let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> him be baniſhed out of the companie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full*,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.17.</note> as a contemner of the church.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>3 But becauſe he intreateth there of ſecret faults wee muſt put this diuiſion, that ſome ſinnes are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1 2"/> and ſome publike. Chriſt ſpeaketh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,<note place="margin">Deuiſion of ſinnes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14.</note> Reproue him betweene him and thee alone*. Paul ſaith concerning open ſinnes, Reproue him in preſence of all men*: that the reſt may feare. Hee himſelfe followed this laſt in Peter*. Therefore in ſecrete ſinnes let vs proceede according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees which Chriſt ſetteth down:<note place="margin">Another deſtinction of ſinnes.</note> in manifeſt ſinnes, let vs ſtraight way proceed vnto the ſolemne rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the church.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let this be alſo another diſtinction. Of ſinnes ſome are defaults, ſome hainous offences: for theſe latter Paul vſeth a more ſharpe remedie in the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon of Corinthus*: becauſe he doth not only in wordes chaſten, but with excommunication puniſh him.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And there be three ends whereto the church hath reſpect in ſuch corrections,<note place="margin">Endes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> and in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. The firſt is that they may not bee named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> among chriſtians which lead a wicked life, as if the holy church were a conſpiracy of wicked men*.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.</note> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecond that good men may not bee corrupted with the continuall companie of the wicked*.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 6.11.</note> The third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is, that thoſe men themſelues, beeing confounded with ſhame,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14.</note> may begin to repent of their filthines*.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:7647:175"/>6 Theſe ends being ſet downe, it remaineth that we ſee how, and after what ſort the church doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute this point of diſcipline,<note place="margin">The diuiſion of ſinnes. Publike. Priuate Stubborneſſe. Haynous offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces. Defaultes</note> which conſiſteth in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. Firſt of all let vs retaine that diuiſion of ſinnes, that ſome are publike and ſome priuate. The former kinde doth not require theſe degrees which Chriſt reckoneth vp. In the ſecond ſort, they come not to the church, vntill ſtubbornnes come. When it is once come to knowledge, then muſt we obſerue the other diuiſion between hainous offences &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults. In lighter offences there muſt a light and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie chaſtiſement be vſed. But hainous offences muſt be chaſtiſed with a more ſharp remedie:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</note> as by depriuing of the ſupper, vntill the ſinner doe teſtifie his repentance*. This order did the olde and better church obſerue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawful gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was in force.<note place="margin">Let Princes ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 So far of was it that anie was exempted from this diſcipline, that the Princes did ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues together with the common people, to abide &amp; beare it. And it is meet that the ſcepters of all princes bee made ſubiect to Chriſtes crowne. So Theodoſius was depriued by Ambroſe of the right of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion*.<note place="margin">Am. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>3.</hi> in orat. funeb. Theo.</note> This is a lawefull proceeding in excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of a man, if not the elders alone do that apart, but the Church knowing and approuing the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And ſuch ſharpneſſe becommeth the church as is ioyned with the ſpirite of meekneſſe, that he may not be ſwallowed vp of ſorrow which is puniſhed*.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</note> For by this meanes a remedie ſhould bee turned to deſtruction.<note place="margin">A caueat. Sharpneſſe of the men of old.</note> For when as they enioyned a ſinner pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to endure for 7. 4. 3. yeres, or during his whole life: what could followe thereupon, but either great hypocriſie, or great deſperation?</p>
               <p n="9">9 All thinges muſt be tempered with loue and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7647:176"/>
curteſie.<note place="margin">All things muſt be temperat with courteſie.</note> Neither is it for vs to blot out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect excommunicate perſons, or bee out of hope of them as if they were alreadie damned. Wee may indeed count them ſtraungers from the Churche, and therefore from Chriſte: but yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie during that time wherein they continue diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <note place="margin">The difference betwene exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and curſing.</note>10 For there is this difference between excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and accurſing that accurſing doth giue ouer a man to eternall deſtruction, taking away all pardon: this that is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth rather pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh maners. There is either rare or none vſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſing. Though the Churche doe not ſuffer vs to keepe companie with excommunicate perſons, yet we muſt ſtriue, and labour to bring them to better fruit,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.15.</note> that they may returne to the fellowſhip of the Church*: leaſt wee fall ſtraightway from diſcipline to butcherie.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <note place="margin">To depart from the church. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont parm cap.</hi> 1.</note>11 This is alſo eſpeciallie required to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating of diſcipline, which Auguſtine diſputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Donatiſts*, that neither priuate men, if they ſee vices not diligently corrected by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Elders, depart from the Church, or that the Paſtours themſelues, if they cannot purge all things which need redreſſing,<note place="margin">What paſtour is free from the curſe.</note> doe not therefore caſt from them their miniſterie, or diſturbe the whole church with vnaccuſtomed ſharpeneſſe. For whoſoeuer doth either by rebuking amend what he can: or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that which hee cannot amende, ſauing the bond of peace: or doth diſalow with equity, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with ſtedfaſtneſſe that which hee cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: hee is quit and free from the curſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And this doth hee ſay, becauſe of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, which when they ſawe vices in the churches, which the Biſhops did reproue with wordes, but
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7647:176"/>

               <p n="13">13 Auguſtine doth principallie commende that one thing, if the infection of ſinne inuade the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, then the ſharpe mercie of liuelie diſcipline is neceſſarie. For ſaith he,<note place="margin">

               <p n="14">14 The other part of diſcipline,<note place="margin">The ſecond part of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faſting.</note> conſiſteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that as times ſhall require, the paſtours exhort either to faſting, or ſolemne praier, or to other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of humilitie, repentance and faith, for which there is neither time, nor maner, nor forme preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the worde of God, but it is left to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church: the obſeruation of this point alſo, as it is profitable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3.</note> ſo it was vſed in the olde churche in the time of the Prophetes and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles*.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Let lawfull faſting haue three endes. For wee vſe the ſame either to bring downe the fleſh:<note place="margin">The ends of faſtinge.</note> or that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we may be better prepared to praiers, or that it may be a teſtimony of our humility before God.

Paule ſaith, that caſting from them ſhame, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more inſolent, then became Chriſtian wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore firſt they profeſſed ſingle life, ſo farre as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the neceſſitie of their function did beare.

               <p n="19">19 And Deaconeſſes were made not to delight God with ſinging &amp; with mumbling not vnderſtood,<note place="margin">The office of Deaconeſſes.</note> and to leade the reſt of their life in idleneſſe which Popiſh Nonnes do: but that they might do to the pore the publike miniſterie of the Church, that they might wholy apply themſelues to the duties of loue. Thereupon I conclude with Paule, that it is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that women ſhould be receaued to vowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie before they be threeſcore yeares of age.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Therefore let vs conclude that as vnlawfull vowes &amp; not rightly made,<note place="margin">Vowes raſhlie made muſt be reuerſed.</note> are of no reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God, ſo ought they to be void with vs. For it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing that we ſhold be driuen to performe thoſe things, which God doth not require at our hands.
